## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adjusts seamlessly between desktop and mobile screens. Flexbox ensures that feature cards stack appropriately, and navigation remains accessible on smaller devices. Media queries are used for breakpoints under 600px.

## 🚧 Known Issues & Areas for Improvement

- **Missing image**: `profile.jpg` is referenced in the HTML but not included in the project folder.
- **README Minimalism**: This version expands on the original minimal README file to improve documentation clarity.
- **CSS Grid**: While Flexbox is used, incorporating **CSS Grid** could further enhance layout variety.
